## WEM-130 | Java Midterm


### Motivation
Through 5 weeks of learning Java, you will now get the chance to put what you've learned to the test. This midterm is
intentionally difficult. It forces you to push the boundaries of your understanding. You will encounter many advanced
topics, as well as some things that I haven't necessarily taught you thoroughly yet. This will be your first foray into 
the real world - where you have to learn to just figure things out. You will come out a better, more experienced
programmer on the other side. Enjoy the process!

### Instructions
1. Deadline: June 4th @ 10AM
2. Clone the project locally
3. Create your own public repository in GitHub and name it: "<StudentID_FirstName> Java Midterm"
4. Once you create your GitHub repo, [click here to add your repo URL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iYGPRPeWNxI-btfnRqXEXMjlU9xJNit8aPGjc6aGotw/edit#gid=0)
5. Point your local repo to your newly created remote repo. To do this:
   - ```git remote -v``` to verify your remote repo
   - ```git remote set-url origin <your repo URL>``` to change the repo to your remote repo
   - ```git remote -v``` to verify your remote repo has changed
6. Locate the `lib` folder found under the project root.
   - You must add all .jar files found within this directory to your project dependencies
     - `File` &rarr; `Project Structure`
     - `Project Settings` &rarr; `Modules`
     - Click `Dependencies` located above the Module SDK dropdown
     - Click `+`
     - Click `JARs or directories`
     - In the explorer, navigate to the lib folder found within the JavaMidterm repo
       - Select/Highlight all the .jar files
       - Click `OK`
     - Click `Apply` and wait for indexing to complete (~15 secs)
     - Click `Save`
7. Commit your changes and push to your remote repo
   - ```git add .```
   - ```git commit -m "Initial Commit"```
   - ```git push -u origin main``` or ```git push -u origin master```


### Thing to Know
1. You should be pushing code to the repo consistently 
   - Work on one file/problem at a time. Once you complete a problem and have tested it thoroughly, create a commit with
   a clear message and push. This is how you will be using Git on the job - you will push your code frequently (every time 
   you solve a problem, make a change, or finish a task). By the end of the midterm, you should have a minimum of 40 
   commits
   - ***DO NOT PUSH ANY CODE CONTAINING ANY KIND OF ERRORS***
2. Read the questions thoroughly and first try to understand what is being asked of you. There are some files in which
   you will do no work, but are critical to solving some other problem.
3. You must complete all parts of each coding/problem-solving question. There are some tasks in here that, while
   optional, you are highly encouraged to attempt AFTER you complete the required portions
4. Google should be used to learn, however, please refrain from copy/paste. I don't really care if you do 
   (although I will be able to tell that you did), but if you still insist in doing so, you should ask yourself one 
   question: are you here to get a good grade a meaningless midterm, or are you here to position yourself to land a 6-figure paying job?
5. Once submissions are in, we will be reviewing the midterm in class together on the due date. So please be prepared to 
   present your solutions.


#### ***ENJOY THE PROCESS & GOOD LUCK!***
